# SSH Hosts Getter

![ssh hosts getter](https://github.com/elsauto/ssh-hosts-getter/blob/main/images/banner.png "SSH + Python")

Very often I find myself looking for the same **hostname** (and/or IP) of a SSH host that I need to access. After doing cat/grep combinations all over the console, I wrote a simple Python script to list all the available ***ssh hosts*** in my config file(s). Yep, I have a buchh of them.

I will start making use of Paramiko soon and extend its functio functionalities. Stay toon.
